# mie1517_project_CartoonGAN

This project addresses the challenge of generating cartoon-style images from real-world photographs using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The main goal is to bridge the stylistic gap between realistic visuals and the expressive, stylized nature of cartoonsâ€”a crucial step as animation gains prominence across film, advertising, gaming, and social media. A notable example is Ne Zha 2, which grossed over $1.7 billion globally, underscoring the growing influence and market potential of animated content.
